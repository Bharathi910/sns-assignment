**Problem Statement 1**: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Problem: Implement a function to preprocess and tokenize text data. 
**Requirements:**
Implement in Python using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
Handle edge cases such as punctuation, stop words, and different cases.

**Problem Statement 2:** Text Generation
Problem: Create a basic text generation model using a pre-trained transformer (e.g., GPT-3).
**Requirements:**
Use the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Generate coherent text based on a given prompt.

**Problem Statement 3:** Prompt Engineering
Problem: Design and evaluate prompts to improve the performance of a given AI model on a specific task (e.g., summarization, question answering).
**Requirements:**
Experiment with different prompt designs.
Evaluate the effectiveness of each prompt using appropriate metrics

**Problem Statement 4:** Data Analysis
Problem: Analyze a dataset and generate insights using a combination of descriptive statistics and visualizations.
**Requirements:**
Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
Provide a Jupyter notebook with the analysis and visualizations.

**Problem Statement 5:** Live Coding Session - API Integration
Problem: Develop a Python script to integrate with an external API and fetch data based on user input.
**Requirements:**
Use the Requests library to make API calls.
Handle API responses and errors gracefully.
Parse and display the fetched data in a user-friendly format.
